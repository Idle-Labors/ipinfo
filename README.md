# WHOIS Geolocator
A simple application which takes an IP address and returns some WHOIS information about it, as well as locating it on a map and displaying it to the user. Designed to be responsive and mobile friendly. Admittedly it is a bit over engineered for what it is but I'm leaving it public because I tike it, you can try it out [here](https://idle-labors.github.io/ipinfo/) for yourself.
